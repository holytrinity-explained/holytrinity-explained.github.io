            <p>The Most Holy Trinity is a mystery doctrine about the Almighty and unseen. He is but one and true God. This doctrine was first-ever written by <i>Tertullian</i>, our Church father. The Holy Trinity cannot be explained by material explanation, etc. Otherwise, Let us see the Holy Trinity according to the Bible.</p>
            <h2>The Father</h2>

            <p>The Father is our God and the first person of the Most Holy Trinity, acknowledged by the incarnated second Person, Jesus Christ, our Lord. The Father is source of all things visible and invisible, means that he created the earth and with the Son he created human according to his likeness. He is seen as a Savior of Israel and of the World. <br><br> He created everything well and he made bad and good life we must choose ourselves, but he advice us to choose the good one.</p>
            <blockquote>
                Genesis 1:1, Gensis 1:26, 1 Corinthians 8:6, Isaiah 43:11, Deuteronomy 30:19.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Son</h2>
            <p>The Son is the second person of the Most Holy Trinity, who is Jesus Christ, our Lord. He is the incarnated Word of God. In one Godship, it is not valid that God does not have the word. But with the word, he is, then, perfect. All things, of course created by The Father through Jesus. Because when <i>God said</i>, it is his word, incarnated to be Jesus that spoke.<br><br> He is one with the Father in essence, for he himself is God and is from God made incarnation, our Lord and mediator. And of course, he is the way and the truth and the life to God the Father. He made nothing but by the will of the Father, that everyone might know that the Father is only and one true God, through Jesus the word of the Father. He was born in Bethlehem to fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah. He is, according to the prophecy of Isaiah, the good Shepherd of the people of Israel, as he said, <i>"I am the good shepherd."</i><br><br>When Thomas saw that he was, indeed, arisen, he said to Jesus, <i>"O my Lord and my God."</i> which by this, Jesus did not prohibit, but he said it is happier to be the one trust him God even not seeing.</p>
            <blockquote>
                John 1:1-3, Jon 10:30, John 13:13, 1 John 17:3, 1 Timothy 2:5, John 14:6, John 5:30, Micah 5:2, John 10:11, John 20:28-29.
            </blockquote>
            <h2>The Holy Spirit</h2>
            <p>The Holy Spirit Proceed from the Father and the Son, which with the Father and the Son altogether glorified and honored, for he is God, because God is Spirit and is holy. He spoke through prophets, for they are anointed through him. Jesus formed in great comission that <i>all nations should be baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit</i> which declaring 1 God in 3 distinct persons.</p>
            <blockquote>
                2 Corinthians 3:17, Isaiah 61:1, Matthew 28:19.
            </blockquote>
